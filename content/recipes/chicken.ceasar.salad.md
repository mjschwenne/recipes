1. Make a dressing by combining minced garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper and the juice from a lemon. Mix well, then set aside.
*[lemon: 1; minced garlic: 1 tbsp; olive oil: 0.5 cups; pepper: some; salt: some]*
2. Heat the grill or grill pan.
3. Take the chicken breast and season each side with salt and pepper. Then add about a teaspoon of dressing to each breast to coat.
*[chicken breast: 4; pepper: some; salt: some]*
4. Slice romaine lettuce heats down the middle, keeping the stem so that it stays together. Add about a teaspoon of dressing to each lettuce half.
