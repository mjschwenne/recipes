1. In a small bowl, beat eggs to mix yolks and white. Place flour in a large mixing bowl, add eggs and salt. Slowly start adding water and beat on low until blended well.
*[eggs: 2; flour: 3 cups; salt: 0.25 tsp; water: 1.2 cups]*
2. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Add salt and some oil to the water.
*[oil: some; salt: 2 tbsp]*
3. With a metal spoon, form dumplings the size of a walnut and drop them into the boiling water by submerging the spoon in the water. Once dumplings are dropped, with a wooden spoon gently stir the water to make sure the dumplings aren't sticking together.
4. Turn water to a low simmer and boil for 4 minutes from the moment they float to the top.
5. Remove with a hand strainer and place on a colander. Sprinkle with a tiny bit of oil to prevent from sticking, if not serving right away.
