## Steps
1. Cut up chicken into about 4 peices each, sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Combine buttermilk and hot sauce in a gallon ziplock bag. Add chicken and keep in fridge at least 4 hours, better overnight.
*[black pepper: to taste; buttermilk: 1.5 cups; chicken: 5-6 boneless breasts; hot sauce: 2 tbsp; salt: some]*
2. Prepare chicken for frying. Create two stations with shallow tupperware. Pour the bag with the buttermilk mixture and chicken into the first station and in the other mix flour, cornmeal, paprika and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper (optional). Add salt and black pepper to taste. Mix well. Take the chicken from the buttermilk mixture and coat with flour mixture. It should be lumpy. Set aside pieces.
*[black pepper: some; cayenne pepper: some; cornmeal: 0.5 cups; flour: 1.5 cups; paprika: 1 tsp; salt: some]*
3. Heat a coating of oil in a large skillet at medium high heat. Once hot, place chicken in pan and cook each side for 3 minutes. Hints: use a timer and do NOT move or touch it once it hits the pan. If you do, you will lost all of the breading. If using a deep fryer, drop the chicken into the oil with the basket submerged rather then place it in the basket before submerging it for the same reason. Once golden brown, you can keep it hot in an oven warmed to 250 degrees.

4. Meanwhile, make the waffles according to Bisquik instructions. I highly recommend adding some old bay to the waffle mix for the extra, savory flavor.
