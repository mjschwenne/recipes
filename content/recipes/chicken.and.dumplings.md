## Steps
1. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Then cut the chicken into stripe.
*[chicken breasts: 6; pepper: 0.5 tsp; salt: 1 tsp]*
2. Melt butter in a large pot and cook the chicken about 5 minutes per side until golden.
*[butter: 4 tsp]*
3. Remove from pan and set aside. To the same pot, add chopped onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
*[chopped onion: 1.5 cups]*
4. Add flour and cook for 1 minute. Temperature here is critical. If it is too hot the flour will burn and ruin the whole dish.
*[flour: 0.5 cups]*
5. Whisk in the chicken stock and bring to a boil, then add diced carrots, chopped celery, thyme, salt and pepper.
*[chicken stock: 1.8 cups; chopped celery: 2 ribs; diced carrots: 3; pepper: 0.5 tsp; salt: 1 tsp; thyme: 0.5 tsp]*
6. Return the chicken to the pot. Reudce to a simmer and cover with lid. Cook on low for 25 minutes.
7. Add heavy cream and dumpling dough (this recipe is a double batch).
*[heavy cream: 0.5 cups]*
8. In a 1 cup measure, break an egg and fill the rest of the cup with milk.
*[egg: 1; milk: 1 cup]*
9. Beat well and stir into the dry ingredients, flour, baking powder, salt. The dough will be incredibly sticky so apply pam to your hands to work with the dough.
*[baking powder: 4 tsp; flour: 2 cups; pam: some; salt: 1 tsp]*
10. Add rosemary to the dumpling dough. Other herbs can be added at your discretion.
*[rosemary: some]*
11. Form the dough into balls with an ice cream scoop and drop directly on top of the chicken base. Make sure each dumpling is in contact with the sauce.
12. Put a clear pie plate over the pot and cook for another 15 minutes. Then check that the dumplings are cooked using a knife until the dough comes out clean.
